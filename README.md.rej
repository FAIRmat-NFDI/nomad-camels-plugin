 ### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD
 
-Modify the text file under `/nomad/default_plugins.txt` and add:
-```sh
-<other-content-in-default_plugins.txt>
-nomad-camels-plugin==x.y.z
-```
-where `x.y.z` represents the released version of this plugin.

-deactivate
-cd <route-to-NOMAD-folder>/nomad
-source .pyenv/bin/activate
-./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
-```
-

-### Build the python package
-
-The `pyproject.toml` file contains everything that is necessary to turn the project
-into a pip installable python package. Run the python build tool to create a package distribution:
-
-```sh
-pip install build
-python -m build --sdist
-```
-
-You can install the package with pip:
-
-```sh
-pip install dist/nomad-camels-plugin-0.1.0
