# NOMAD CAMELS Plugin

Plugin for HDF5 (`.nxs`) files coming from NOMAD CAMELS.

This `nomad` plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter` along with `@nomad`'s [`cookiecutter-nomad-plugin`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/cookiecutter-nomad-plugin) template.

## Adding this plugin to NOMAD

Currently, NOMAD has two distinct flavors that are relevant depending on your role as an user:
1. [A NOMAD Oasis](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-nomad-oasis): any user with a NOMAD Oasis instance.
2. [Local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-local-nomad-installation-and-the-source-code-of-nomad): internal developers.

### Adding this plugin in your NOMAD Oasis

Read the [NOMAD plugin documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html) for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD instance.

### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD

Modify the text file under `/nomad/default_plugins.txt` and add:
```sh
<other-content-in-default_plugins.txt>
nomad-parser-plugins-camels-files==x.y.z
```
where `x.y.z` represents the released version of this plugin.

Then, go to your NOMAD folder, activate your NOMAD virtual environment and run:
```sh
deactivate
cd <route-to-NOMAD-folder>/nomad
source .pyenv/bin/activate
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
```

Alternatively and only valid for your local NOMAD installation, you can modify `nomad.yaml` to include this plugin, see [NOMAD Oasis - Install plugins](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html).


### Build the python package

The `pyproject.toml` file contains everything that is necessary to turn the project
into a pip installable python package. Run the python build tool to create a package distribution:

```sh
pip install build
python -m build --sdist
```

You can install the package with pip:

```sh
pip install dist/nomad-parser-plugins-camels-files-0.1.0
```

Read more about python packages, `pyproject.toml`, and how to upload packages to PyPI
on the [PyPI documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).


### Template update

We use cruft to update the project based on template changes. A `cruft-update.yml` is included in Github workflows to automatically check for updates and create pull requests to apply updates. Follow the [instructions](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-03-github-actions-prevent-github-actions-from-creating-and-approving-pull-requests/) on how to enable Github Actions to create pull requests.

To run the check for updates locally, follow the instructions on [`cruft` website](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#updating-a-project).
