Follow the instruction here to use the plugin in your NOMAD Oasis installation. 1. Create a CAMELS Measurement File \u00b6 There are two ways you can upload a CAMELS file to NOMAD: 1.1 Manual File Upload \u00b6 Use NOMAD CAMELS to perform a measurement and create a datafile. This datafile has a .nxs file ending. You can upload this file manually by dragging and droping the file into an upload. 1.2 Automatic Upload \u00b6 You can login to NOMAD within CAMELS and then choose auto-upload and select the correct upload you want to upload to. Every measurement will then be automatically uploaded to the given upload . 2. Processed Files \u00b6 After uploading your CAMELS file you should see two files. One is the raw .nxs file and one is the .archive.json . Relevant File The relevant file is the .archive.json file of type CamelsMeasurement . 3. Contents of the CamelsMeasurement File \u00b6 The CamelsMeasurement file contains all relevant information saved by CAMELS during the measurement. Here is an example of what this could look like: 4. Browse Measurements in the CAMELS App \u00b6 Finding your measurement files can be quite difficult. The CAMELS App makes this quite easy. Simply navigate to Explore > CAMELS App On the left sidebar you can find all the available filters to filter and search through your measurements. In the center you will find all the CamelsMeasurement that match your fitlers and searches. Things you can search for: Sample: The sample you had selected in CAMELS while running the measurement Start time: The time you started the measurement Session name: Session name you entered in CAMELS Tags: Tags you added before you started the measurement User: Name of the user selected in CAMELS Instrument name: Names of the instruments that were used in the measurement script. Custom quantities: You can sear all custom quantities with this filter. You can for example search for text you entered in the measurement_description or protocol_description . Enter \"camels\" in the quantity field to get a full list of searchable quantities. Here is an example of the app with several measurements.","title":"Use this Plugin"},{"location":"how_to/use_this_plugin.html#how-to-use-this-plugin","text":"This plugin can be used in a NOMAD Oasis installation.
